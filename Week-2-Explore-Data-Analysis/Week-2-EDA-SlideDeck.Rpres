What is exploratory data analysis?
========================================================

Wikipedia says it pretty well - 

> "... an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods ("Exploratory data analysis", accessed on 2020-08-29)"

* Summarize main characteristics
    - Where is the center of our data? -> **average** or **mean**
    - How spread out are our data? -> **variance** and **standard deviation**
* Visual methods
    - When done well, we can 'see' trends and patterns in data very well

Measure of center - Mean
========================================================

The *mean* (commonly called the *average*) is probably to best known measure of the *center* of a data set. 

$$
\overline{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}
$$  


where $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ represent the $n$ observed values in a sample.

Measure of center - Mean
========================================================
incremental: false

The *mean* (commonly called the *average*) is probably to best known measure of the *center* of a data set. 

$$
\overline{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{x_i}{n}
$$  


where $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ represent the $n$ observed values in a sample.

Sample Mean vs. Population Mean
========================================================
type:prompt

Technically $\bar{x}$ is the **sample mean**. This is the mean of $n$ observations (our sample) taken from a population.

The **population mean** is also computed the same way but is denoted with the symbol $\mu$. It is often not possible to calculate $\mu$ since population data are rarely available.

The sample mean is a **sample statistic**, and serves as a **point estimate** of the population mean. This estimate may not be perfect, but if the sample is good (representative of the population), it is usually a pretty good estimate. 


Measure of center - Median
========================================================

The **median** is the value of the *middle* observation in a sample.  

If the number of observations is 

- Odd, the median is the middle observation
- Even, the median is the average of the two middle observations

*Note: The median is the $50^{th}$ percentile; 50% of observations lie below/above the median.*


Measure of center - Median
========================================================

Consider these data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x = sample(1:100, size = 11)
print(x)
```

Now order them

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sort(x)
```

Median is: `r median(x)`


Measure of spread - Variance and Standard Deviation
========================================================

The **standard deviation** measures (approximately) the distance between a typical observation and the mean. 

* An observation's *deviation* is the distance between its value $x$ and the sample mean $\overline{x}$ - i.e., $(x - \overline{x})$

* The **sample variance** $s^2$ is the sum of squared deviations divided by the number of observations minus 1

$$
s^2 = \frac{({x_1 - \overline{x})}^{2}+({x_2 - \overline{x})}^{2}+\cdots+({x_n - \overline{x})}^{2}}{n-1} 
$$

where $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ represent the $n$ observed values.

Measure of spread - Variance and Standard Deviation
========================================================

The **standard deviation** $s$ is the square root of the variance.

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{({x_1 - \overline{x})}^{2}+({x_2 - \overline{x})}^{2}+\cdots+({x_n - \overline{x})}^{2}}{n-1}}
$$

using the summation notation:

$$
s = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
$$

Sample Standard Deviation vs. Population Standard Deviation
========================================================
type:prompt

Like sample mean and population mean, we differentiate between 
**sample standard deviation** and **population standard deviation**.

While there are subtle mathematical differences between these two values,
for our purposes, know that:

* Population SD,  $\sigma$, is the standard deviation of a set of data for an entire population
* Sample SD,  $s$, is the standard deviation of a set of data for a *sample* of values from a population

Measure of spread - Quartiles and IQR
========================================================

Quartiles - where **quarters** of the data are

* The 25th percentile is also called the first quartile, $Q_1$.
* The 50th percentile is also called the median.
* The 75th percentile is also called the third quartile, $Q_2$~.

Between Q1 and Q3 is the middle 50% of the data. The range these data span is called the interquartile range, or the **IQR**.

$$
IQR = Q_3 - Q_1
$$

Robust estimates
========================================================

The **median** and **IQR** are called robust estimates because they are less likely to be affected by extreme values than the mean and standard deviation.

For distributions containing extreme observations, the median and IQR provide a more accurate sense of center and spread.

Case study: the FAMuSS study
========================================================

*The Functional polymorphisms Associated with human Muscle Size and Strength* (FAMuSS)
study and data are introduced in the 'Introductory Statistics for Life and Biomedical Sciences' textbook, Section 1.2.2.

One goal of the study was to examine the association of demographic, physiological, and genetic characteristics with muscle strength.

- In simpler terms, study the "sports gene" **ACTN3**.

*We'll use these data to demonstrate data visualizations.*

Four rows from FAMuSS data matrix
========================================================

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(oibiostat)
data(famuss) 
```  

```{r kable, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(famuss[c(1,2,3,595),c( "sex", "age", "race", "height", "weight", "actn3.r577x", "ndrm.ch")], digits = 1, caption = "*Introductory Statistics for Life and Biomedical Sciences* Table 1.6", row.names=FALSE)
```  

FAMuSS Variables and their descriptions
========================================================

|Variable|Description|
|:-------|:----------:
|sex|  Sex of the participant |
|age|  Age in years   |
|race|  Recorded as African Am (African American), Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, Other |
|height|  Height in inches    |
|weight|  Weight in pounds  |
|actn3.r577x|  Genotype at the location r577x in the ACTN3 gene. |
|ndrm.ch|  Percent change in strength in the non-dominant arm, comparing strength after to before training|

Viewing a long list of numbers
========================================================

These are the values for `height`. What do you see here?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
famuss$height
```

Histograms
========================================================

```{r hist_weight}
hist(famuss$weight)
```

Histograms
========================================================

* Histograms provide a view of the *data density*. We often refer to this as the ***distribution*** of the data.
    * Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common.
    * Lower bars represent where the data are relatively less common.
* Histograms are especially convenient for describing the *shape* of the data distribution.
* The chosen *bin width* can alter the story the histogram is telling.

Histograms - changing bin width
========================================================

```{r hist_weight_binwidth, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

theme_set(
    theme_classic(base_size = 18)
)

b50 <- ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 50)
b30 <- ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 30)
b10 <- ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
b1 <- ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
plot_grid(b50, b30, b10, b1, labels = c("50", "30", "10", "1"), nrow = 2)

```

Shape of a distribution: Modality
========================================================

Does the histogram have a single prominent peak (unimodal), several prominent peaks (bimodal/multimodal), or no apparent peaks (uniform)?

![Modality](modality.png)

*Note: In order to determine modality, step back and imagine a smooth curve over the histogram - imagine that the bars are wooden blocks and you drop a limp spaghetti over them, the shape the spaghetti would take could be viewed as a smooth curve.*

Shape of a distribution: Modality
========================================================

```{r, echo = FALSE}
one_mode <- ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = weight, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram() + geom_density(lwd = 2)
bimode_data <- c(rnorm(n = 250), rnorm(n = 250, mean = 5))
bimode <- ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = bimode_data, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram() + geom_density(lwd = 2)
multimode_data <- c(rnorm(n = 100), rnorm(n = 100, mean = 3, sd = 0.5), rnorm(100, mean = 6))
multimode <- ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = multimode_data, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram() + geom_density(lwd = 2)
uniform <- ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = runif(50000), y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram() + geom_density(lwd = 2)

plot_grid(one_mode, bimode, multimode, uniform, nrow = 2)
```

Shape of a distribution: Skewness
========================================================
left:70%

Is the histogram **right skewed**, **left skewed**, or **symmetric**?

```{r skew, echo = FALSE}
right_skew <- ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = bmi, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram() + geom_density(lwd = 2)
sym_data <- ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = height, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1.5) + geom_density(lwd = 2)

covid_deaths <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/qsvc2uf6u2d52pt/deaths_by_age_group.csv?dl=1")
left_skew <- ggplot(data = covid_deaths, aes(x = Age.Group, y = Count)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=90))

plot_grid(right_skew, sym_data, left_skew)
```

***

*Note: Histograms are said to be skewed to the side of the long tail.*


Boxplots
========================================================

A boxplot indicates the positions of the first, second, and third quartiles of a distribution in addition to potential **outliers**, observations that are far from the center of a distribution.

- Large outliers: values > $Q_3 + (1.5\times IQR)$ 

- Small outliers: values < $Q_1 - (1.5 \times IQR)$

Boxplots
========================================================

```{r boxplot, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = sex, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()
```

***

* The rectangle extends from the first quartile to the third quartile, with a line at the second quartile (median).

* Whiskers capture data between $Q_1 - (1.5 \times IQR)$ and $Q_3 + (1.5\times IQR)$ ; whiskers must end at data points.

* Potential outliers shown with dots.


Data visualization
========================================================
type:alert

Numbers are great, but ...

Always visualize your data!

Data visualization
========================================================

All of these images have $\bar{x} = 54.26$, $\bar{y} = 47.83$, $s_x = 16.76$, $s_y = 29.93$, and $corr = -0.06$!

Categorical data - Tables
========================================================
incremental: false
left: 80%

A table for a single variable, a **frequency table** or **one-way table**, summarizes the distribution of observations among categories.

Considering the data from the *FAMuSS* study, we can use this table to describe the distribution of the genotype at the location *actn3.r577x* among the study participants.

***

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(table(famuss$actn3.r577x))
```

Categorical data - Bar plots
========================================================

A bar plot is a common way to display a single categorical variable.

```{r barplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = actn3.r577x)) + geom_bar(stat = "count") 
```

Examining relationships between two variables
========================================================

Approaches for summarizing relationships between two variables vary depending on variable types...

- Two numerical variables
- Two categorical variables
- One numerical variable and one categorical variable

Here we will focus on visual methods to assess these relationships.
We will address mathematical methods to assess these relationships in more depth later in the semester.

Two numerical variables - Scatter plots
========================================================

Two variables $x$ and $y$ are 

- **positively associated** if $y$ increases as $x$ increases. 
- **negatively associated** if $y$ decreases as $x$ increases.

Height and weight are positively associated.

***

```{r scatterplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = famuss, aes(x = height, y = weight, color = sex)) +
  geom_point()
```

Two numerical variables - Correlation
========================================================

Correlation is a numerical summary that measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables.

 - Introduced in Section 1.6.1 of the text (details in Ch. 6).
 
 - The correlation coefficient $r$ takes on values between -1 and 1.
 
 - The closer $r$ is to $\pm 1$, the stronger the linear association.

In this case, the correlation between `height` and `weight` is `r cor(famuss$height, famuss$weight)` - positive and moderately strong
