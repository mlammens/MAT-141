Data storage
How are you going to record your measurements?
You will likely have hard copies (handwritten) of your data from the field
Need to put these data into an electronic format for further analysis
EXERCISE - With a partner, put the data from the data sheets I’ve handed out into a Google Sheets file.

Demonstrate “Long” format
Emphasize that each row corresponds to one individual that was measured
Show that some information is redundant (e.g., Site, Location, Plot, etc.), but that this is necessary so that each row has all the important information about that individual!
The long format makes sorting easier, and all sorts of analyses later on.
