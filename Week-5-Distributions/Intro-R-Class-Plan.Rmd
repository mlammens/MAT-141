# Today's Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session you should be able to:

* Perform basic arithmetic using R/RStudio
* Identify the major components of the RStudio interface
* Create an R Notebook (R markdown) file and use it to document a sequence of R functions
* Read in a data set and perform basic data summary procedures in R


# Getting started in RStudio

## Accessing RStudio via Pace Virtual Lab

You should be able to use these steps each time you start your RStudio session.

1. Log on to the Pace VirtualLab by going to [https://virtuallab.pace.edu/](https://virtuallab.pace.edu/)
2. Select the **RStudio** App
3. Use your Pace log in credentials to log on to the Windows computer that pops up in your browser
    * iPad users, note you may have to use the Cisco connect 'hamburger' menu in the top-center of the browser to select your keyboard.
4. Create or Open a new **Project**
    * Select the **Project: (None)** icon on the upper lefthand corner
    * For a new project, select **New Project**
    * To open an existing project, select **Open Project ...**
    * In either case, when you get to "Browse..." for a file location, select the "Network" button, **THEN** select the "This PC" button.
    * Under the "This PC" folder, scroll down to select your Pace User ID folder under "Network location"
    * From here you can either save your new project or open your existing project

## Downloading R and RStudio on your personal computer

Follow the two-step directions noted here: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). **Make sure to install R, THEN RStudio.**

Now that we have access to RStudio, let's have a look at the components here.

## Overall layout

There are four panels in the RStudio interface (though you may only have three open when you first start it), each has valuable information.

* Console / Terminal panel (lower-left)
* Environment / History / Git (upper-right)
* Files / Plots / Packages / Help (lower-right)
* Source / Editor (upper-left)

### File management

Before we do anything in R/RStudio, let's make a new folder on our computers where our class data can reside.
You can use your operating systems file manager (i.e., Finder on Mac and Windows Explorer on Windows) to created a new folder where ever suites you. 
**Call this new folder `MAT-141-FA22`. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT PUT THIS FOLDER ON YOUR DESKTOP.**
We'll use this folder/directory later when we are asked to set our 'working directory' and when we need a place to store `*.R` and `*.Rmd` files.

See the screen shot below for an example of creating a new folder using Mac Finder.

![](New-Folder.png)

### Making an R Project

Go back to RStudio.
Let's make a new R Project associated with your `MAT-141-FA22` directory. 
To make a new project, go to the upper right-hand side of the RStudio interface, where it says **Project: (None)**.
Click the little downward arrow, select "New Project", then select "Existing Directory" from the window that pops up. 
Use the graphical user interface (GUI) to navigate to the `MAT-141-FA22` directory, then select "Create Project".
Once you've created your project, your RStudio session will restart in this project.

There is also now a file in the folder you just made that ends in *.Rproj.
If you double click on this file, RStudio will open, opening this project at the same time.
This is a good way to re-open RStudio for your next session.

### Getting help

* **Help** panel (lower right corner)
* `help.search`

```{r}
help.search("bar plot")
```

#### Challenge

Use the `help.search` function to search for something in statistics that you think should be in R? Did you find anything?

* I know my function - just give me the details - `?barplot`


# R as calculator

We can use R just like any other calculator. 
Go to the **Console** tab and type the following and press enter:

```{r}
3 + 5
```

You should see the value of the equation "spit out" below the text you wrote.

There's internal control for order of operations (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally)

```{r}
(3 * 5) + 7
```

```{r}
3 * 5 + 7
```

```{r}
3 * (5 + 7)
```

## Internal functions

There are a ton of internal functions, and a lot of add-ons.

```{r}
sqrt(4)
abs(-5)
```

## Documenting your work

### R script file

We can execute any/all of the commands and functions we will learn this semester in the console, but this is generally *not* what we will do.
Best practice for using R is to store your work in an R script or an RMarkdown document.
We use these because it's easier to go back and re-run our code and to document our analytical steps / process.
We won't be working with R script files this semester, but you should be aware of their existence.

### Rmd file

Use this to integrate text and R code into the same document.

Using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), we can integrate descriptive text, R code, and the output from that code, into a seamless document that can be easily **reproduced**.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 
While some of the details of using Markdown (and thus R Markdown) can get tricky, the basics are very easy to pickup.
RStudio even comes with two very useful tools to learn and use Markdown. 
First, go to the `Help` tab and select `Markdown Quick Reference`.
Second, a more detailed reference can be found in the `Help` -> `Cheatsheets` section.

### Markdown vs R Markdown

R Markdown is a tool that allows you to make a simple text document using the Markdown formatting syntax **with** R code and associated output embedded. 

### Starting with R Markdown

Go to the new file button (upper left corner of the RStudio interface, or `File` -> `New File`) and choose the R Markdown option. 
A screen will pop-up requesting information such as Title, Author, and Output Format. 
Give your new doc a title and select **HTML** as the output format.
A new file that is pre-populated with a bunch of text will open in the `Source` panel.

We will go over each section briefly:

* Header
* Sections
* Code Chunks (The code chunk syntax is *very* specific and important. As a beginner, you may choose to use the GUI button to make empty chunks - it's the little green box with a **C** in it and a plus sign.)

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Click **Knit** now to see what happens.


**Important:** within an R file, you can use the `#` sign to add comments. Anything written after the `#` is *not* interpreted when you run the code.

**Important:** we can write commands in our R script file, then run/execute those commands by pressing `CMD` + `RETURN` (Macs) or `CNTR` + `RETURN` (Windows). We can also execute only a section of code by highlighting it and pressing these same key strokes.

# Variables and objects

There are several basic types of data structures in R.

* **VECTORS**: One-dimensional arrays of numbers, character strings, or logical values (T/F)
* **FACTORS**: One-dimensional arrays of factors (Stop - Let's discuss factors)
* **DATA FRAMES**: Data tables in which the various columns may be of different type
* **MATRICES**: In R, matrices can only be 2-dimensional, anything higher dimension is called an array (see below). Matrix elements are numerical; some functions, like the transpose function t(), only work on matrices
* **ARRAYS**: higher dimensional matrices are called arrays in R
* **LISTS**: lists can contain any type of object as list elements. You can have a list of numbers, a list of matrices, a list of characters, etc., or any combination of the above.

## Functions that are useful for understanding the different types of data structures

These functions will tell you what *kind* of variable you are dealing with, as well as some additional information which may be useful as you advance in your use of R.

```
str()
class()
```

## Practice with variables

Let's define a variable.

```{r}
my_var <- 8
```

And another

```{r}
my_var2 <- 10
```

Work with vars

```{r}
my_var + my_var2
```

Make a new variable

```{r}
my_var_tot <- my_var + my_var2
```

***

#### Challenge

Change the value of my_var2

```{r}
my_var2 <- 3
```

What is the value of `my_var_tot` now?

***

## Make a vector

Let's combine multiple values into a vector of length greater than 1.

```{r}
# Vector of variables
my_vect <- c(my_var, my_var2)

# Numeric vector
v1 <- c(10, 2, 8, 7, 11, 15)

# Char vector
pets <- c("cat", "dog", "rabbit", "pig")
```

Making a vector of numbers in sequence

```{r}
v2 <- 1:10
v3 <- seq(from = 1, to = 10)
```

***

# Data frames

## Reading in your own data

One of the most basic things you will need to do in R is read in your own data set. 
You can read in Excel files, simple text files, and even files from Google Sheets.
But the easiest type of file to read in is a comma separated values (CSV) file. 
You can save an Excel workbook (or Numbers workbook or Google Sheet) as a CSV file by using the "Save as ..." menu item. 

Let's read in the soil data from past activities using the function `read.csv`.
Note that in this example, we are reading this file using a URL that points to it, but you can just as easily read in a file on your local system (in fact, this is much more common!).

```{r soil_data}
soil_data <- read.csv("https://mlammens.github.io/ESA-2021-BEDE-Network/docs/soil_nutrient_data.csv")
```


Let's have a brief look at these data.

```{r}
head(soil_data)
tail(soil_data)
```

As we saw in our previous activity, these data include nutrient measurements at multiple different sites on a suburban campus. 
The data set also includes information about where the data samples were collected and the conditions of the site during collection.

#### `summary` function

Let's begin by using the `summary` function to examine this data set.
`summary` returns many of the standard statistics.
When doing data exploration, a few things you want to look at are:

* How do the mean and median values within a variable compare?
* Do the min and max values suggest there are outliers?
* Which variables (i.e., columns) are quantitative (numeric) versus categorical (factors or characters)

```{r}
summary(soil_data)
```

#### A (very) brief introduction to navigating a `data.frame`

We will be very brief here. 
Check out 
[this Data Carpentry lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology/03-data-frames.html) for more information.

* Looking at specific `data.frame` elements. Use *row* and *column* notation.

Here is the 5th row, 3rd column (Site).
**Note: We are using square brackets to index the `data.frame` and we *always* use [row, column] notation.**

```{r}
soil_data[5, 3]
```

* Looking at an entire column.

Here are two ways to get the `pH` column.

First, **note: we leave the row part blank, but still add the comma.**

```{r}
soil_data[ ,5]
```

Second, **use only the variable (column) name. Note the use of the `$` operator**

```{r}
soil_data$pH
```

* Looking at specific column entry

This is another way to look at the 5th entry in the `pH` column.

```{r}
soil_data$pH[5]
```

* Looking at all entries for a given row.

Here's all the entries for the 5th row.
**Note: here we leave the column part blank, but still add the comma.**

```{r}
soil_data[5, ]
```

* Looking at a set of rows and/or columns.

Here's all the entries in the 5th through 10th rows, 5th through 7th columns.
**Note: we use the `:` operator to look at a range of value.**

```{r}
soil_data[5:10, 5:7]
```

* For `data.frame`s, if you do not use row, column notation, you will get only the columns back.

```{r}
head(soil_data[5:7])
```

***

#### Challenge

What am I going to get if I execute the command below?

```{r, results='hide'}
head(soil_data[c("site","phosphorus_lbacre")])
```

***


## Basic data visualization

There are many data visualization tools in R, and a very rich ecosystem of add-on [packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html) that make it easy to create publication ready figures.
Here we will learn a few basic visualization tools.

### Visualization using the `ggplot2` package

We are going to introduce a data visualization package called **ggplot2**.
This package is great for producing publication quality graphics, but the syntax
used to create a plot is a little more involved than base R (i.e., the `graphics` package).

### Aside: Installing and loading packages

First, we need to install the `ggplot2` package.

**STOP** did you install the `tidyverse` package?

```{r installggplot2, eval=FALSE}
# Only need to do this once
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Then load it:

```{r loadggplot2, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

**NOTE: You will only have to install a new package once, but you will need to call the `library` function at the beginning of every new R session.**

### Historgrams

Let's make a histogram of some of the nutrient data

```{r}
ggplot(data = soil_data, aes(x = pH)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Let's break down this call to introduce a few key things about ggplot

* ggplot: the initial canvas we're working on
* geom: geometric objects (i.e. the type of plot - histogram, points, line, etc) 
* aes: aesthetic mapping 

***

#### Challenge - use `?geom_histogram` to determine how to change the number of bins used

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = soil_data, aes(x = pH)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15)
```

***

### Scatter plots

Next let's make a scatter plot, showing pH versus phosphorus.

```{r}
ggplot(data = soil_data, aes(x = pH, y = phosphorus_lbacre)) +
  geom_point()
```

**THAT SEEMS SO COMPLICATED!**

It's true. The syntax for ggplot can seem pretty complicated. 
But the power of ggplot lies in the ability to lay several geometries (geoms) over each other.
Also, each geometry has a rich set of options. 
For example, let's say I want to create the plot we just made, but I want to jitter the points (so they aren't overlapping) and add a trend line.

```{r}
ggplot(data = soil_data, aes(x = pH, y = phosphorus_lbacre)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Boxplots

Lastly, let's make a box plot. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = soil_data, aes(x = site, y = phosphorus_lbacre)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data = soil_data, aes(x = site, y = pH)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
