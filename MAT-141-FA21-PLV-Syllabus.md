Course description
------------------

This course provides a non-calculus based introduction to statistics,
with a focus on applications in the life sciences: biology,
environmental science, forensic science, and health care. Topics covered
include data gathering, numerical and graphical data summaries;
elementary probability; binomial, normal and sampling distributions;
confidence intervals; hypothesis testing; t-tests; regression and
correlation; analysis of variance; and non-parametric statistics. This
course includes the use of the R programming language to analyze data
sets.

Rationale 
---------

Scientists and biomedical professionals need to analyze data to get insights from their observations, determine what the best practices in a field are, and evaluate hypotheses. 
Further, the ability to analyze data is a key part of effective science communication. 
This course will provide students basic analysis techniques. 
Additionally, the methods of biostatistical analysis are applicable in all fields relating to science, whether they are applied directly when analyzing data or indirectly by providing a structure to interpret scientific findings.

Course learning objectives
-------------------

During this course, students will be introduced to the mathematics of basic principles of statistics and learn how to apply these principles to data analysis and data communication. Specific course learning objectives are:

* To become familiar with different data collection approaches and identify the uses and limitations of these approaches in context of life science applications.
* To acquire the knowledge and skills to confidently carry out exploratory data analyses, including the ability to construct effective data visualizations.
* To develop and practice the skills of evaluating data quality. 
* To be able to identify the most appropriate analysis techniques to use with a given data set.
* To acquire the knowledge and skills to confidently perform standard data analysis techniques, including T tests, linear regression, ANOVA, and $\chi^2$ tests.

Required Text
-------------

Vu, J. and Harrington, D. Introductory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences, **[First
Edition]{.underline}**. OpenIntro Project (available for free at
<https://www.openintro.org/book/biostat/>)

Required Software
-----------------

We will use a spreadsheet software (Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets) and the R and RStudio software packages in this class.
All programs are freely available (MS Excel is free for Pace students).

### Installing R/RStudio on your computer

**Download and install the latest version of R and RStudio before the
second class meeting.** Do not install beta versions which may still
have 'bugs'.
It is important that you install R first, then install RStudio.

-   R can be found at <https://www.r-project.org/>
-   RStudio can be found at
    <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>.

### Using Pace's Virtual Lab

If you would prefer not to install R/RStudio on your computer, you can connect to Pace's Virtual Computer Lab, and use RStudio there. 
To go to the virtual lab, you can go to [https://virtuallab.pace.edu/](https://virtuallab.pace.edu/). 
You will log-in with your UID and password **and** need a second password via the Duo Mobile app (the same app you use to connect to your portal and email while off-campus).



Assessment
----------

I will assess your achievement of the course learning objectives and class learning outcomes based on your performance on the formative and summative assessments listed below. 
In calculating your final score, I will drop the lowest quiz score and the lowest analysis review/write-up score.

* 10% = Class participation - during class meetings there will be small, low-stakes assignments you are expected to submit. Your participation will be based on these submissions.
* 20% = Quizzes - quizzes will assess your understanding of the weekly lecture material and readings. Quizzes will generally be multiple choice and short-answer questions, delivered through the **Classes LMS**, and due before class on Monday.
* 20% = Analysis reviews/write-ups - Some of our in-class time will be dedicated to working through applications of statistics in the life sciences. In groups of 2 - 3 students you will write-up the results of these analysis applications. You will submit your write-ups as both an Rmd file (when appropriate) and a Word file.
* 20% = Term project - during the course of the semester, you will carry out an independent analysis project. The project includes three distinct submissions - a proposal, an update, and the final submission. See schedule for associated due dates.
* 30% (10% each) = Three exams - Exams will be in class. I will provide a formula sheet and you can bring a single page of notes. **No calculators are allowed.**

The following is the **course grading scale**:

A 100%-94%; A- 93%-90%\
B+ 89%-87%; B 86%-83%; B- 82%-80%\
C+ 79%-75%; C 74%-70%; C- 69%-67%\
D+ 66%-63%; D 62%-60%\
F below 60%\



Course Policies
---------------

### Attendance

Attendance and punctuality are expected.
However, given the extraordinary times we are working through, excused absences will be granted if you contact me by email.

### Late assignments

Quizzes must be taken by their due date. You will receive a zero if you
miss a quiz. For assignments, you will lose 10% of your earned credit
for each day you are late. After 5 days, you will receive *at most* 50% of the credit for an assignment.

### Technology in the Classroom

Use of computers, tablets, and cell phones is necessary to complete some
in-class assignments. However, I expect you to be respectful and
professional, and not to be "surfing the internet" or texting during
class.

## University Policies and Resources

### Pace University COVID-19 Safety

With the Delta variant of COVID-19 now dominant, New York City and Westchester are both designated as areas of “high community transmission.” 
Under current guidance from the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, face coverings are recommended in such areas. 
Effective immediately, Pace University is requiring face coverings to be worn indoors on all our campuses. 
We are also encouraging face coverings outdoors, in situations when distance cannot be maintained. 
Any student entering class without a face covering will be asked to: a) don a face covering or b) go to Security to obtain a face covering if the student does not have one. 
Students who do neither of these things will be asked to leave class and they will be marked absent for the session. 
This policy will be re-evaluated as conditions change.

Vaccines are required for everyone in our community coming to campus, beginning on August 16, 2021. 
If you have not yet uploaded your vaccine record, please do so immediately via the confidential [Patient Portal](https://shibboleth.pace.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?execution=e1s1).

Students in this course are required to adhere to Pace University's [Academic Integrity Code](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/2021-04/academic-integrity-code.pdf), which supports honesty and ethical conduct in the educational process. It educates students about what constitutes academic misconduct, helps to deter cheating and plagiarism, and provides a procedure for handling cases of academic misconduct. Students are expected to be familiar with the Code, which can be found in [Policies and Procedures](https://www.pace.edu/student-handbook/university-policies-disciplinary-and-grievance-procedures). Individual schools and programs may have additional standards of academic integrity. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the policies of the schools, programs, and courses in which they are enrolled.  

### Procedure for Students Who Wish to Obtain Reasonable Accommodations for a Course

The same rigorous standards for admission apply to students with and without a disability. In order to support the continued success of students with disabilities, the University prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability and is committed to ensuring equal access for students with disabilities to its facilities, programs, and activities. The University’s commitment to equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities includes providing reasonable accommodations for the needs of students with disabilities.

To request an accommodation for a qualifying disability, a student must self-identify and register with the Disability Services Office for his or her campus. The Office of Disability Services is housed in the Counseling Center on the New York City and Pleasantville campuses. No one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need and arrange for an accommodation except the Coordinator of Disability Services. Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact the Coordinator of Disability Services on behalf of a student.
