## Introduction

In this assignment, you will write and knit an Rmd file to show an analysis of the soil phosphorus data we worked with on the first day of class.

## R Markdown

**REMOVE THE "R Markdown" SECTION FROM THE FINAL COPY THAT YOU SUBMIT. THIS INFORMATION IS JUST MEANT TO HELP YOU LEARN ABOUT THE RMD FORMAT.**

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk as we do below, to read in the soil P data set.

You can execute the R code below by either using one of the "Run" functions (look in the upper-right corner of the editor pane), or by pressing CMD + ENTR (Mac) or CNTR + ENTR (Windows) while your cursor is on the line you wish to execute.


## Read in soil P data set

```{r soil_data}
soil_data <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/b8vanatf6kejuba/soil_p_data.csv?dl=1")
summary(soil_data)
```

## Study details

*Replace this text with text describing the study. Specifically, address whether this study is a **observational** or **experimental** study, what the variables are, and what types of variables they are.*


## Calculating mean and standard deviation

Using what you have learned in today's class, write code below in the R chunk to calculate the mean (function `mean`) and standard deviation (function `sd`) for the pound of phosphorus per acre (phosphorus_lbacre) values **for each site**. 
At the end of this chunk, you should have calculated **five** different mean and standard deviation values.

```{r}

```


### Interpretation

*Replace this text with your interpretations of what any observed differences and/or similarities in the means and standard deviations tells us about phosphorus levels in the soil at these five sites.*
