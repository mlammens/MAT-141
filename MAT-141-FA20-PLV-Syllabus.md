Course description
------------------

This course provides a non-calculus based introduction to statistics,
with a focus on applications in the life sciences: biology,
environmental science, forensic science, and health care. Topics covered
include data gathering, numerical and graphical data summaries;
elementary probability; binomial, normal and sampling distributions;
confidence intervals; hypothesis testing; t-tests; regression and
correlation; analysis of variance; and nonparametric statistics. This
course includes the use of the R programming language to analyze data
sets.

Rationale {#rationale-1}
---------

Scientists need to analyze data in order to evaluate hypotheses and
extract further insights from their observations. Further, the ability
to analyze data collected during lab and field work is a key component
of effective science communication. This course will provide students
with these techniques. Additionally, the methods of biostatistical
analysis are applicable in all fields relating to science, whether they
are applied directly when analyzing data or indirectly by providing a
structure to interpret scientific findings.

Learning objectives
-------------------

-   How to perform exploratory data analysis.

-   How to evaluate data quality.

-   Methods to visualize patterns in data.

-   How to identify the most appropriate analysis techniques to use with
    a given dataset.

-   How to perform standard data analysis techniques, including linear
    regression, ANOVA, and generalized linear modeling.

Assessment
----------

I will assess your achievement of the learning objectives based on your
performance on the following formative and summative assessments. In
calculating your final score, I will drop the lowest quiz score and the
lowest analysis review/write-up score.

Quizzes - 20%

R / `learnr` modules - 20%

Analysis reviews/write-ups (Group work) - 10%

Term project - 15%

Three exams - 30% (10% each)

The following is the **course grading scale**:

A 100%-94% B- 82%-80% D+ 66%-63%

A- 93%-90% C+ 79%-75% D 62%-60%

B+ 89%-87% C 74%-70% F below 60%

B 86%-83% C- 69%-67%

We will use the R and RStudio software packages in this class.
**Download and install the latest version of R and RStudio before the
second class meeting.** Do not install beta versions which may still
have 'bugs'.

Course Policies
---------------

### Attendance

Attendance and punctuality are required. Excused absences will be
considered, but must be discussed with Prof. Aiello-Lammens. Unexcused
absences and/or consistent lateness will negatively impact a student's
final assessment and could result in failure.

### Late assignments

Quizzes must be taken by their due date. You will receive a zero if you
miss a quiz. For assignments, you will lose 10% of your earned credit
for each day you are late. After 10 days, you will receive a zero.

### Technology in the Classroom

Use of computers, tablets, and cell phones is necessary to complete some
in-class assignments. However, I expect you to be respectful and
professional, and not to be "surfing the internet" or texting during
class.

### Academic integrity

All members of the Pace community are expected to behave with honesty
and integrity, as outlined in the student handbook. The following
statement is from the Student Handbook:

> Students are required to be honest and ethical in satisfying their
> academic assignments and requirements. Academic integrity requires
> that, except as may be authorized by the instructor, a student must
> demonstrate independent intellectual and academic achievements.
> Therefore, when a student uses or relies upon an idea or material
> obtained from another source, proper credit or attribution must be
> given. A failure to give credit or attribution to ideas or material
> obtained from an outside source is plagiarism. Plagiarism is strictly
> forbidden. Every student is responsible for giving the proper credit
> or attribution for any quotation, idea, data, or other material
> obtained from another source that is presented (whether orally or in
> writing) in the student's papers, reports, submissions, examinations,
> presentations and the like.
>
> Individual schools and programs may have adopted additional standards
> of academic integrity. Therefore, students are responsible for
> familiarizing themselves with the academic integrity policies of the
> University as well as of the individual schools and programs in which
> they are enrolled. A student who fails to comply with the standards of
> academic integrity is subject to disciplinary actions such as, but not
> limited to, a reduction in the grade for the assignment or the course,
> a failing grade in the assignment or the course, suspension and/or
> dismissal from the University.

In this class, any violations of this code will be reported to the
Academic Integrity Committee, and sanctions will be applied, including,
but not limited to, receiving zero credit for dishonest work or exams.

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

The University's commitment to equal educational opportunities for
students with disabilities includes providing reasonable accommodations
for the needs of students with disabilities. To request an accommodation
for a qualifying disability, a student must self-identify and register
with the Coordinator of Disability Services for his or her campus. No
one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need and arrange
for an accommodation except the Coordinator of Disability Services.
Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact the
Coordinator of Disability Services on behalf of a student. For further
information, please see Information for Students with Disabilities on
the University's web site.\
To receive accommodation for any disability, students must contact the
campus Counseling Center (Pace Plaza, 212-346-1526; Westchester,
914-773-3710).
