MAT 141 -- CRN 71034: INTRODUCTORY STATISTICS FOR THE LIFE SCIENCES
===================================================================

**Credits:** 4\
**Meeting day and time:** Monday and Wednesday, 7:55 AM to 9:55 AM\
**Term:** Fall 2020\
**Location:** Environmental Classroom\
**Professor:** Dr. Matthew Aiello-Lammens\
**Email:** <maiellolammens@pace.edu>\
**Phone:** (914) 773-3110\
**Office Location:** 102 Environmental Classroom Building\
**Office Hours:** TBD\

**Course delivery format / modality:**

For Fall 2020, this course will be taught as **web-assisted**. 
Lectures will be delivered asynchronously as pre-recorded videos.
Each lecture will be associated with a discussion forum, where you can ask questions and discuss the content.
Synchronous face-to-face meetings will be scheduled with smaller groups (1/4 of the class at a time). 
These meetings can take place in-person in the Environmental Classroom or via Zoom, depending on student requests. 
All exams will be 'take-home' format.
Several class meetings will occur synchronously online via Zoom during the semester.

**Course Learning Management System:**

We will be using **Classes** instead of Blackboard for this course. 
*Why?* The University is switching over to Classes this coming Spring, but because it provides a nicer and more functional mobile device interface (i.e., phones and tablets), I decided to move over sooner. 
You can log-in to **Classes** at [https://classes.pace.edu](https://classes.pace.edu).


Course description
------------------

This course provides a non-calculus based introduction to statistics,
with a focus on applications in the life sciences: biology,
environmental science, forensic science, and health care. Topics covered
include data gathering, numerical and graphical data summaries;
elementary probability; binomial, normal and sampling distributions;
confidence intervals; hypothesis testing; t-tests; regression and
correlation; analysis of variance; and non-parametric statistics. This
course includes the use of the R programming language to analyze data
sets.

Rationale {#rationale-1}
---------

Scientists and biomedical professionals need to analyze data to get insights from their observations, determine what the best practices in a field are, and evaluate hypotheses. 
Further, the ability to analyze data is a key part of effective science communication. 
This course will provide students with these techniques. 
Additionally, the methods of biostatistical analysis are applicable in all fields relating to science, whether they are applied directly when analyzing data or indirectly by providing a structure to interpret scientific findings.

Course learning objectives
-------------------

During this course, students will be introduced to the foundational mathematics of the basic principles of statistics and learn how to apply these principles to data analysis and communication. Specific course learning objectives are:

* To become familiar with different data collection approaches and identify the uses and limitations of these approaches in context of life science applications.
* To acquire the knowledge and skills to confidently carry out exploratory data analyses, including the ability to construct effective data visualizations.
* To develop and practice the skills of evaluating data quality. 
* To be able to identify the most appropriate analysis techniques to use with a given data set.
* To acquire the knowledge and skills to confidently perform standard data analysis techniques, including T tests, linear regression, ANOVA, and $\chi^2$ tests.

Assessment
----------

I will assess your achievement of the course learning objectives and class learning outcomes based on your performance on the formative and summative assessments listed below. 
In calculating your final score, I will drop the lowest quiz score and the lowest analysis review/write-up score.

* 20% = Quizzes - quizzes will assess your understanding of the weekly lecture material and readings. **A quiz is due nearly every Friday** (see schedule for exceptions). Quizzes will generally be multiple choice and short-answer questions, delivered through the **Classes LMS**.
* 20% = R / `learnr` modules - **before each synchronous small group meeting** you are expected to complete a self-paced tutorial in R/RStudio. I will go over how to complete these tutorials during our first group meetings. 
* 10% = Analysis reviews/write-ups (Group work) - our synchronous small group meetings will be dedicated to answering any questions you have and to working through applications of statistics in the life sciences. In groups of 3 - 4 students you will write-up the results of these analysis applications. You will submit your write-ups as both an Rmd file and a Word file.
* 15% = Term project - during the course of the semester, you will carry out an independent analysis project. The project includes three distinct submissions - a proposal, an update, and the final submission. See schedule for associated due dates.
* 30% (10% each) = Three exams - Exams will be take-home and open-book. You will be expected to carry out an analysis and answer questions related to the analysis in long-form. You will submit your exam as both an Rmd file and a Word file.

The following is the **course grading scale**:

A 100%-94%; A- 93%-90%\
B+ 89%-87%; B 86%-83%; B- 82%-80%\
C+ 79%-75%; C 74%-70%; C- 69%-67%\
D+ 66%-63%; D 62%-60%\
F below 60%\

Course Policies
---------------

### Attendance

Attendance and punctuality during your in-person and/or synchronous meeting session are expected.
However, given the extraordinary times we are working through, excused absences will be granted if you contact me by email.

### Late assignments

Quizzes must be taken by their due date. You will receive a zero if you
miss a quiz. For assignments, you will lose 10% of your earned credit
for each day you are late. After 10 days, you will receive a zero.

### Technology in the Classroom

Use of computers, tablets, and cell phones is necessary to complete some
in-class assignments. However, I expect you to be respectful and
professional, and not to be "surfing the internet" or texting during
class.

### Academic integrity

All members of the Pace community are expected to behave with honesty
and integrity, as outlined in the student handbook. The following
statement is from the Student Handbook:

> Students are required to be honest and ethical in satisfying their
> academic assignments and requirements. Academic integrity requires
> that, except as may be authorized by the instructor, a student must
> demonstrate independent intellectual and academic achievements.
> Therefore, when a student uses or relies upon an idea or material
> obtained from another source, proper credit or attribution must be
> given. A failure to give credit or attribution to ideas or material
> obtained from an outside source is plagiarism. Plagiarism is strictly
> forbidden. Every student is responsible for giving the proper credit
> or attribution for any quotation, idea, data, or other material
> obtained from another source that is presented (whether orally or in
> writing) in the student's papers, reports, submissions, examinations,
> presentations and the like.
>
> Individual schools and programs may have adopted additional standards
> of academic integrity. Therefore, students are responsible for
> familiarizing themselves with the academic integrity policies of the
> University as well as of the individual schools and programs in which
> they are enrolled. A student who fails to comply with the standards of
> academic integrity is subject to disciplinary actions such as, but not
> limited to, a reduction in the grade for the assignment or the course,
> a failing grade in the assignment or the course, suspension and/or
> dismissal from the University.

In this class, any violations of this code will be reported to the
Academic Integrity Committee, and sanctions will be applied, including,
but not limited to, receiving zero credit for dishonest work or exams.

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

The University's commitment to equal educational opportunities for
students with disabilities includes providing reasonable accommodations
for the needs of students with disabilities. To request an accommodation
for a qualifying disability, a student must self-identify and register
with the Coordinator of Disability Services for his or her campus. No
one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need and arrange
for an accommodation except the Coordinator of Disability Services.
Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact the
Coordinator of Disability Services on behalf of a student. For further
information, please see Information for Students with Disabilities on
the University's web site.\
To receive accommodation for any disability, students must contact the
campus Counseling Center (Pace Plaza, 212-346-1526; Westchester,
914-773-3710).

### Pace University COVID-19 Safety

CDC guidelines and University policy require proper face covering use in all classrooms, conference rooms, hallways, elevators, and other common areas. 
Face coverings are required even if you are more than 6 feet from another individual in a common indoor area. 
We must work together to protect others and ourselves from the transmission of COVID-19.  
Any student entering class without a face covering will be asked to: a) don a face covering or b) go to Security to obtain a face covering if the student does not have one. 
Students who do neither of these things will be asked to leave class and they will be marked absent for the session. 
Students are expected to be familiar with the current COVID-19 regulations, which are posted on the [Return to Campus](https://www.pace.edu/return-to-campus) website. 
See also [up-to-date policies and announcements](https://www.pace.edu/return-to-campus/communications-resources#recent) and more information about [Pace University’s response to COVID-19](https://www.pace.edu/coronavirus).
