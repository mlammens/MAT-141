# Planning document for MAT 141: Intro to Stats for Life Sciences at Pace University during Fall 2020

* COVID 19 - special circumstances

## Ideas

* Break class into 4 groups. Meet with each group for one hour per week, either in person or via Zoom.



## Some ideas for group meetings

* Data vis - disect a visualization on COVID from a news source, such as NYT or FiveThirtyEight, and from CDC (or Johns Hopkins site)
* Conditional probability - COVID testing specificity and sensitivity (could also do this with Lyme pretty easily) 


## Some ideas for assignments and problems

* For group projects, identify each persons contribution and role.
* Make a discusion board for each lecture. Allow for bonus points for participating in the discussion.
