# Planning document for MAT 141: Intro to Stats for Life Sciences at Pace University during Fall 2021

## COVID 19 - special circumstances

In FA20, the classroom occupancy was limited to 8 students, which required rotating of students in person. 
FA21 starting plans are to return to fully in-person with no occupancy restrictions.

## Ideas

* Instead of starting with R/RStudio in week 1/2, have students start with Google Sheets.
* Keep 'lectures' online



## Some ideas for group meetings

* Data vis - dissect a visualization on COVID from a news source, such as NYT or FiveThirtyEight, and from CDC (or Johns Hopkins site)
* Conditional probability - COVID testing specificity and sensitivity (could also do this with Lyme pretty easily) 


## Some ideas for assignments and problems

* For group projects, identify each persons contribution and role.
* Make a discussion board for each lecture. Allow for bonus points for participating in the discussion.
