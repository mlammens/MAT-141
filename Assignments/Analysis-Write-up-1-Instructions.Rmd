## Learning Objective

In this assignment, you will apply the main concepts we have gone over in class so far to analyze and contextualize an existing data set. 

## Data Set 

To complete this assignment, you will use the *FAMuSS* data set that is associated with your textbook, and that we used in **Meeting 5 - More EDA practice**.
I have provided this data set to you as a comma separated values (CSV) file as part of the 'Meeting 5' materials. 
You should download that data set, and then load it into Google Sheets, MS Excel, or another spread sheet program to complete your analysis.

## Using the Write-up Template

I am providing you with a write-up template. 
This includes the scoring rubric embedded in the document. 
When you use this document to write your Analysis Write-up, you **must** remove all of the guidance text I provide (it's all in italics), but keep the section titles.
