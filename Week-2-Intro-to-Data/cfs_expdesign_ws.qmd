# Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360490) (CFS), also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), is a complex and long-term illness characterized by extreme fatigue that doesn't improve with rest and worsens with physical or mental activity. 
The exact cause is unknown, but researchers believe it may involve a combination of factors such as infections, immune system changes, and hormonal imbalances. 
Because the symptoms are varied and the causes are not fully understood, CFS presents a valuable case study for exploring how scientists design experiments to investigate complex medical conditions.

# Does Cognitive Behavioral Therapy treat CFS?

A group of scientists would like to test whether having patients undergo Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can relieve their CFS symptoms.^[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a structured, goal-oriented form of psychotherapy that helps individuals identify and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors to improve emotional and physical well-being.] 
Their treatment variable is whether a patient receives CBT or receives instructions on how to relax.
After treatment, they can record whether the patients CFS symptoms improve or not.
