## Intro (8:00 AM to 8:10 AM)

**Using "Classes" during class**

* Classes / Brightspace - our Learning Management System for this course (and for the future!)
* "In class" submissions and assignments will be through Classes
* We'll go through the class format and more on using our LMS after our activity for the day

## Activity - Make a data poster (8:10 AM to 8:50 AM)

**Practice making pictures with data**

This assignment is described more fully in the **Case Studies** section of the **First Class** module

Briefly, you will create a poster that describes and visualizes the data you have been given, and addresses the following questions:

* What is the question the research was asking?
* What are the data provided?
* Can you come up with a hypothesis related to these data?
* What do you conclude based on these data?
* What information do you wish you had?

## Gallery "Walk" - A sample of posters (8:50 AM to 9:00 AM)

* Four randomly selected groups will present their posters

### 5 MINUTE BREAK

## Go over how to review our classmates posters (9:05 AM to 9:10 AM)

* Discussion board forum on Classes

## Discuss some possible data visualization (9:10 AM to 9:25 AM)

* Link provided after class!

## Course logistics (9:25 AM to 9:45 AM)

This semester will be an adventure! We're in this together, so please communicate with me!

### Class meetings

* Most classes will be 'small group' sessions.
* **Group A** is online (via Zoom). We can add more online options as needed.
* Small group sessions will focus on R, problem solving, and applications.
* Any 'full class' sessions will be online.
* On the days that your group is *not* meeting, you should use that time to watch posted lectures, do the reading, go over the week's checklist, etc..
* Exams are take home - they will require you to use R.
* Please email me about any accommodations.

### Syllabus

* There are a lot of categories in the 'assessment' section. Most of these are meant to be 'low-stakes' and taking into account that we will *not* be meeting for 3-hours that we would during a normal semester.
* The textbook is freely available as a PDF, and pretty cheap on Amazon.
* Why R/RStudio? In short, because it's industry standard. Also, data science is a marketable skill to have. Lastly, programming helps you learn in other ways.
